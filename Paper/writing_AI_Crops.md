# Prior Progress

When comparing crop cultivars of a century ago and those of today, considerable differences are often observed. Improvements to yield, plant architecture, and biotic and abiotic resistances, among other traits, have been targeted by increasingly complex breeding and management strategies since the early part of the 20th century. (timeline of improvements from phenotyping + selection ~1910s - 1960s)

With the increase in genetic technology availability and decrease in cost during the (1980s-2000s), targeted improvements through approaches such as marker assisted selection became feasible.
